Initialize typescript: tsc --init
   --> It will create tsconfig.json 

Initialize npm: npm init -y
   --> Create package.json file 

1) Now create files like index.html
2) Create two folders 'src' & distributor as 'dist'
3) Create index.tsc in src & index.js in dist.
4) Now, I want when we run the index.tsc, it's js part should go in index.js
which is under dist folder. For that we have to do minor change in tsconfig.json 

5) In tsconfig.json: make (outdir:./dist/ ) means we'r saying where to put js part.

6) Also don't compile index.tsc using 'tsc index.tsc', instead use command: 'tsc -w'

7) tsc -w: is watch mode, it see tscconfig.json where to put js & any change in tsx file 
will be shown in js file as well.
